border-radius
    -has four values - top left corner, top right corner, bottom-left corner, bottom-right corner

@keyframes
    -CSS styles specified inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times
    -animation must be binded to an element - e.g. div element

    e.g. 
    /* The animation code */
    @keyframes example {
        0%   {background-color: red;}
        25%  {background-color: yellow;}
        50%  {background-color: blue;}
        100% {background-color: green;}
    }

    /* The element to apply the animation to */
    div {
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        background-color: red;
        animation-name: example;
        animation-duration: 4s;
    }

Animation - attributes
    -animation-iteratoin-count 
        -have animation run forever
    -have animation run forever
        animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    -animation-duration 
        set how long the animation runs forever
    -animation-delay
        delays start of animation
        negative values make animation start as though it was N seconds in

    normal - The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is default
    reverse - The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)
    alternate - The animation is played forwards first, then backwards
    alternate-reverse - The animation is played backwards first, then forwards

    shorthand
    animation: <name> <duration> <timing-function> <delay> <iteration-count> <direction>

3D transform
    -repositions an element in 3D space
    -transform: translate3d(42px, -62px, -135px);

Scale
    -part of transform attribute
    scale(<width> <height>)

Transform-origin attribute
    -allows you to change the position of transformed elements
        -e.g. think of a long rectangle being rotated on its axis
        https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/trycss3_transform-origin_inuse.htm
    -important when 2D and 3D transforms warp the location of the element
        transform-origin: <x-axis> <y-axis> <z-axis>
